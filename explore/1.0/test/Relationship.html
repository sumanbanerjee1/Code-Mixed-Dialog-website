<b>Speaker B:</b> I'd be glad to tell you what I think.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Good! I'm interested in your advice.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> OK, Nick . Here's the question, What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture?

<b>Speaker B:</b> The Godfather and The Godfather II, of course . They were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Whew! I'm impressed! You really know your stuff!</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Let's string the lights first.Then we won't have to mess up the decorations.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Hand me some globes and paper flowers, I'll put them on these top branches.

<b>Speaker A:</b> There ,...we're about done.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Can you speak Japanese?

<b>Speaker B:</b> Yes, I can, but not very well.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Where did you learn it?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Do you drink the Robust Milk every day?

<b>Speaker B:</b> Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? five bucks?

<b>Speaker A:</b> Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know, I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.

<b>Speaker B:</b> I don ’ t know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate.

<b>Speaker A:</b> But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway, I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China, for example, they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Come on, son, you ’ re looking at this too naively, the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Yes, the chicken looks wonderful!

<b>Speaker B:</b> I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Are you serious? You studied mathematics at college for four years, and now you have a job working with your hands!

<b>Speaker B:</b> Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge, and creativity . I love this job.

<b>Speaker A:</b> I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work.

<b>Speaker B:</b> I didn ’ t, but I applied for an apprenticeship, and since I studied math, AND I have a good attitude, my application was accepted.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Rose, the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Then, what shall we do on Sunday.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Let ’ s think this through . First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this? Second of all, you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her, so cut the crap and do it!

<b>Speaker B:</b> I don't care . I need money.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime, but do you think it's really worth?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ...

<b>Speaker A:</b> The old page was okay, alright, but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume, because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action, and the results are smashing ...

<b>Speaker A:</b> First, the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing .

<b>Speaker B:</b> It's time to go . Bye, Ella . Hope to see you soon</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips, so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too.

<b>Speaker B:</b> What did he look like before his dog bit his face off?

<b>Speaker A:</b> He was actually quite handsome . What a shame.

<b>Speaker B:</b> What's he going to do now?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Such as?

<b>Speaker B:</b> Sure . Speaking of photos, what type of film will be the best? You know, I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley.

<b>Speaker A:</b> I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity.

<b>Speaker A:</b> I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me.

<b>Speaker B:</b> You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party.

<b>Speaker B:</b> I come from England.

<b>Speaker A:</b> What's the climate like in your country?

<b>Speaker B:</b> It's mild, but it's not always pleasant.The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East . It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the South.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Which seasons do you like best?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight, the time when the New Year really comes, we exchange' Happy New Year' to each other, and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper, in them are some what we call' Lucky Money.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Who will get the money?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Just in Beijing, people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Well, he ’ s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn.

<b>Speaker B:</b> I liked him too . He is so cute! You know, even though I was slightly disappointed, I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release?

<b>Speaker A:</b> I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode, I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Are you interested in history?

<b>Speaker B:</b> Yes, I am . I enjoyed studying it at school, though I had trouble remembering all the dates, so my teacher never gave me good marks.

<b>Speaker A:</b> I love history, but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> I basically believe in science over theology . I mean, I believe in evolution for example . However, there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet.

<b>Speaker B:</b> I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong.

<b>Speaker A:</b> For example?

<b>Speaker B:</b> Religions preach tolerance, but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> My name's McDonald.

<b>Speaker B:</b> And we ’ re on the brink of soccer history today, as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup!

<b>Speaker A:</b> The ref calls the players for the kick off, and here we go! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield, but, oath, it ’ s out of bounds.

<b>Speaker B:</b> That will be a throw in for Brazil . Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin, and the ref has called him offside.

<b>Speaker A:</b> No question about it . He was offside by a mile! We have a goal kick for Ecuador . Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia, he shoots! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Delgado takes the corner . We have a foul! Oh no, Did, the goalkeeper, has fouled the Ecuadorian player! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick!</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son, doctor.

<b>Speaker B:</b> No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way, do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> John, do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic?
