<b>Speaker B:</b> You know what, I think I know who my admirer is.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> How can I be sure your products are of superior quality, as you promised?

<b>Speaker B:</b> One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system, which is the best of its kind.

<b>Speaker A:</b> But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard.

<b>Speaker B:</b> We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis .

<b>Speaker A:</b> What a pity!</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Definitely . The minutes have to be taken accurately.

<b>Speaker B:</b> But I am not familiar with the members of the board.
