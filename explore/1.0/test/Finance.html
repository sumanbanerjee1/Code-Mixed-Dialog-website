<b>Speaker B:</b> I didn ’ t bring cash with me today.

<b>Speaker A:</b> I ’ m sorry, but you can ’ t take the items until you can buy them.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Good morning . Madam . How can I help?

<b>Speaker B:</b> I'd like to take some money from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Is that possible here?

<b>Speaker A:</b> Certainly . We can transfer the money straight into your bank account here and then you can withdraw it right away . Could I have your Passbook for Bank-Securities Account Transfer?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> What about the outer packing?

<b>Speaker B:</b> We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton, gross weight around 25 kilos a carton.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Cartons?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> After you've thought it over, get back to me and we can go ahead.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Miao Ping, if I do decide to go ahead, how will the interest if I exceed be counted?

<b>Speaker A:</b> It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits.

<b>Speaker B:</b> So, if I do decide to go ahead, how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you?

<b>Speaker A:</b> First of all, you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> That's too late . You see, November is the season for this commodity in our market, and our Customs formalities are rather complicated.

<b>Speaker B:</b> I understand.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Besides, the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus, after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> No, probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours.

<b>Speaker B:</b> But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month? Because, I mean, I won't be working so many hours.

<b>Speaker A:</b> I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks, we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes, then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you?

<b>Speaker B:</b> I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods, interest rates, things like that, please.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Certainly . Do you currently bank with us?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands.

<b>Speaker B:</b> But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery? Make a special effort, please . A timely delivery means a lot to us.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Good afternoon . Welcome to Lincoln Bank, how can we be of service?

<b>Speaker A:</b> Just pulling up your information now . Yes, some documents arrived for you from Sapporo.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Oh great! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them?

<b>Speaker A:</b> Actually, there is a problem . It's the goods description, it's a little different on the invoice, but this does happen sometimes.

<b>Speaker B:</b> No, everything has to be perfect.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . If shipment is too late, we'll have to turn to other suppliers.

<b>Speaker B:</b> I am sorry, but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Can you find some way for an earlier delivery?

<b>Speaker B:</b> How's this then? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Sounds like a good idea.

<b>Speaker B:</b> We propose to deliver 50% in June and the balance in Aug.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Morning . May I help you?

<b>Speaker B:</b> Hello, Miao Ping, I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me?

<b>Speaker A:</b> Well, Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So, this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So, if we look within the line of basic deposit, the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal.

<b>Speaker B:</b> What if I exceed?

<b>Speaker A:</b> If it goes beyond the basic deposit, the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Hello, how can I help?

<b>Speaker B:</b> OK, well, I'm going to Europe . I guess 1,000 USD will be sufficient for now.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> What can I do for you?

<b>Speaker B:</b> Hello, there . I've just started using your net banking and I'm looking for some information about my Commission Fund.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Regarding what exactly?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Well, it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Can you speed it up and let me have it today? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now, you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then, we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points, the DOW JONES indicator also suffered! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago.

<b>Speaker B:</b> How is this possible? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return!

<b>Speaker A:</b> I know sir! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Oh, such a variety . All of them are excellent both in color and flavour . No wonder our people like China ’ s tea better than any other kind . Could you give me some idea of the prices?

<b>Speaker B:</b> Here is our price list . All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . You can see the prices are reasonable.

<b>Speaker A:</b> I'd like you to quote me CIF Karachi.</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-bottom footer"><div class="container clearfix"><div class="rightNav"><div><ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"><li><a href="/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/">Code-Mixed Dialog</a></li></ul></div></div></div></nav><script src="/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/javascripts/hilitorModified.js"></script><script src="/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/javascripts/removeStopWords.js"></script><script src="/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/javascripts/highlighting.js"></script><script src="/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/javascripts/evaluate.js"></script><script src="/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/Code-Mixed-Dialog-website/javascripts/model.js"></script></body></html>
