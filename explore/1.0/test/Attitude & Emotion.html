<b>Speaker B:</b> Thank you, I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it.

<b>Speaker A:</b> You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find, right?

<b>Speaker B:</b> Well, yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Now, the effort pays off . You have accomplished something.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> I'm tired of dancing.

<b>Speaker B:</b> But to me it's really enjoyable.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> They promised us a sea view.

<b>Speaker B:</b> Well, you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys.

<b>Speaker A:</b> Isn't it awful? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Is your boss Chinese?

<b>Speaker B:</b> No, he's from Australia . Before I met him, I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things.

<b>Speaker A:</b> What are you going to do?</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Tom, is Jenny crying?

<b>Speaker B:</b> I can ’ t believe this! Why are all these things happening to me! I can ’ t take it anymore! Let me out of the car!</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> I guess you are right.But what shall we do? I don't feel like sitting at home.

<b>Speaker B:</b> I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends.

<b>Speaker A:</b> That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them.</pre></div></div><div class="para-wrap"><div class="row"><pre><b>Speaker A:</b> Hey, your Chinese is coming along!

<b>Speaker B:</b> You think?

<b>Speaker A:</b> I have tried . But Americans like butter, bread, sugar, and cream too much.

<b>Speaker B:</b> I suppose you ’ re right, Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight.
